# RN-chat-app-backend

This is a very simple go backend for [this](https://github.com/quarian/RN-chat-app). It runs on Heroku, but serves only http
POST requests designed for the frontend app.

As with many first time projects, this was built on top of existing base (which you migh already realize from the
many contributors). The base is from here: [Getting Started with Go on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-go)
